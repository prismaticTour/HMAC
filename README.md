# HMAC
simple python based program to show HMAC authentication with pickle

Done just to demonstrate what HMAC does to lower minds!  :P

When data is entered, it will create a pickle file where the passwords will be stored n at the first login of the user.

AS hashing is generally a one-way operation, during any login of a registered user, password entered is hashed ad compared to the stored hash for authentication (DUH!).
